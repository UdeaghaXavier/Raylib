Core:
    - Evolution Simulator
        - Grid Based system for movement 
        - Python and Raylib

Mechanics:
    Overview:
    -- ENTITY
        - 3 major Classes (These clesses will then hopefully be mutated to give the OPTIMAL stats fpr survival)
                            size    vision   col
            -- Assasin    0.3, 0.5   8,10   green
            -- Norms      0.5, 0.8   7,4    blue
            -- Tanks      0.8, 1.0   2,5    pink

        - STATS
            - Hunger = 10
                - Constant for all classes but diminishes proporionally to size
                - hunger_rate = 1 + (size / 4)
            - Vision
                - Determines how easy it is to find food.. 
            - Speed
                - Constant for all classes, has a value of 1 or variies with 2 = size
                - Determines how many cells the entity can tranverse each turn
            - Size
                - The size as a percentage of each grid
                - Size is more or less the most import factor
            - Strenght
                - Acts as both Damage and HP
                - Stronger Entities will survive more fights
                - Though ur strenght doesnt reset till uve eaten
            - Age
                - More or less a percentage in 0.3, 0.6 and 1.0 for child, teenager and adult respectively
                - Until adult hood, stats will be only be a fraction of what they shld be
        - PROGRESSION
            - 100 entities are spawned initially
            -- AIM: To determine how long it takes for the entire civilization to have only one or no surviors
                - Hopefully have a way to track the generations
        
        - LOGIC
            -- MOVEMENT:
                - Entities traverse the cell with their set speed
                - Entities move randomly till their hunger gets below the treshold
                - Once this happens, they first check if they can find any food with their eyes
                - If they can, they move towars it
                - If they cant, they attempt following the stench.. the stench is supposed to be a 
                    - little bit misleading till you can see the food, evey once in a
                - - while a random position towards the food is chosen
            -- COMBAT:
                - Entities will try to avoid fights they cant win (especially assasins), they'll evaluate 
                    -  the opponents size (not strenght)
                - If they end up not avoiding it, the strongest will win (strenght dependent)
            -- REPRODUCTION:
                - Entities can reproduce and give birth to offsprings with stats on avergae with their parent
                - Both need to atleast meet the hunger critaria, 0.6
                - Reproduction takes strenght, (1 - hunger)
                - The offsprings have a chance of getting mutated to either improve or spoil their stats 
                    - (the deviant stats are chosen at random, the same with how mush the stats deviate)

    -- FOOD
        - is spawned randomly accros the map until the quota is reached.. not one at a time but all at once 
        - it replenished hunger and strenght and it emits a stench in a 10 cells radius
        - Food can also be found by stench (max distance for smell to be detected is 10) or by sight
        - Food strench reduces each turn by a certain value (maybe .5)
        - Once this stench reaches 0, food rots (thus disapears)

    -- UI
        - Game Speed Label and control
        - Pause menu 
        - Controls Menu (Tweak core values, like number of initial entities
            - food spawn_rate)
        - Zoom 
        - Hover over entities to show their stats

    -- Visualization
        - Collect data from the simulataion
        - Compile it somehow, to plot a graph for major stats or progresses through out
