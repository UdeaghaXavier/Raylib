🧬 Evolution Simulator - Development Roadmap

A step-by-step guide to building your simulation efficiently.

Check = ✔️

TODO

🟢 Phase 1: Core Systems (Foundation)

1️⃣ Grid System (Movement & Positioning)

[✔️] Implement a 2D grid using a list-based structure.

[✔️] Define cell size and grid dimensions.

[✔️] Create a function to convert (x, y) to grid coordinates.

[ ] Implement entity movement:

[ ] Random movement when not hungry.

[ ] Food-seeking movement when hungry.

[ ] Speed-based movement logic.


🔵 Phase 2: Entities (Survival Mechanics)

2️⃣ Entity System (Stats & Behaviors)

[ ] Create an Entity class with:

[ ] Size, Speed, Vision, Strength, Hunger, Age.

[ ] Entity types: Assassin, Norms, Tanks.


[ ] Implement hunger system:

[ ] Hunger reduces over time.

[ ] Hunger rate scales with size.


[ ] Implement food detection:

[ ] Check food within vision range.

[ ] Check for scent (gradually weaker over distance).


[ ] Implement movement logic based on hunger.



🟡 Phase 3: Combat & Reproduction

3️⃣ Combat System

[ ] Implement collision detection between entities.

[ ] Define combat rules:

[ ] Compare entity strength.

[ ] Weaker entity tries to flee (size-based avoidance).

[ ] If they fight, stronger entity deals damage.

[ ] If HP reaches 0, entity dies.


4️⃣ Reproduction & Mutation

[ ] Implement reproduction conditions:

[ ] Both parents need at least 0.6 hunger.

[ ] Reproduction costs strength (1 - hunger).


[ ] Implement mutation system:

[ ] Randomly modify size, vision, speed.

[ ] Adjust mutation chances dynamically.



🟠 Phase 4: Food System

5️⃣ Food & Scent Mechanics

[ ] Randomly spawn food across the grid.

[ ] Implement scent decay (-0.5 per turn).

[ ] Remove rotten food (scent = 0).

[ ] Eating restores hunger & strength.



🟣 Phase 5: UI & Visualization

6️⃣ UI & Debugging Tools

[ ] Add a Game Speed Controller.

[ ] Implement Pause Menu.

[ ] Add Entity Stats on Hover.

[ ] Implement a zoom function.


7️⃣ Data Visualization

[ ] Collect simulation data.

[ ] Plot graphs showing:

Population over time.

Mutation trends.

Survival rates per class.


🚀 Phase 6: Optimization & Polish

[ ] Optimize grid performance (avoid excessive loops).

[ ] Fine-tune mutation and survival balance.

[ ] Add color-coded visualization for food, scent, and fights.
